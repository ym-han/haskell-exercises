to see how this works: 
Î»> interleave 1 [2]
[[1,2],[2,1]]

   interleave 1 [2:[]] = (1:2:[]) : map (2:) (interleave 1 [])
                       = (1:2:[]) : map (2:) [[ 1 ]]
                       = (1:2:[]) : [[ 2, 1 ]]    -- Note that this will error if don't have parens around first group
                       = [[1,2],[2,1]]

Then try suppose we do interleave 1 [2, 3] == [[1,2,3], [2,1,3], [2,3,1]] ...
